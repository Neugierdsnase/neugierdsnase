I hate WordPress. I don't like PHP either. If anything I am biased in the opposite direction. Still, I am convinced, that WordPress is the only viable option for someone trying to take on web development clients as a solo freelancer.

Admittedly, due to some frustrating early experiences, my experience working as a freelancer is pretty limited. I decided that explaining the pros and cons of certain implementations to technically illiterate "decision-makers" was neither time well spent, nor beneficial to my mental well-being. In my experience, they often have a hard time admitting they don't know or understand something, confidently making decisions and then discovering their implications when time and money have already been invested, just to then reverse the decisions.

"If we give you the contract, would you use WordPress or HTML to realize it", I once got asked by a manager trying to signal Lord knows what. Anyone reading this blog (except for my mom) knows how bizarrely unqualified this question is (I'll explain it to you in person, love you ðŸ˜˜). It was then I decided that walking from client to client explaining the most basic concepts over and over again wasn't for me, given that the alternative was to discuss data stractures, programming languages and software architecture with people much smarter than me.

## Wasn't this supposed to be about WordPress?

Yes, sorry, my point is this: What I have learned from freelancing is, that most companies, that approach a freelancer, which usually means they do not have a technical product and therefore no technical talent in-house, only need you to set up a WordPress blog for them. Install a theme and two or three extensions (usually security, SEO, analytics) and you're already set to receive rambling, pointless feedback and vague reiteration requests from your client.

The other option would be, to write everything from scratch, bleeding edge, you can use React, you can use even use Svelte or Solid. It will be technically excellent and the Lighthouse score will reflect that, because you are a master of this craft and you will produce a marble, you can already feel it.
