<article class="prose mx-auto mt-4 xl:prose-xl 2xl:prose-2xl" style="transform: translate(0px);"><p class="lead">This blog is documenting my journey from being a
    professional React developer, to becoming proficient in
    WebAssembly using the Rust programming language. Follow
    this blog via RSS to get irregular updates and findings
    along my journey.
  </p>
  <p>Learning Rust is an intimidating task for anybody, but
    for a self-taught web developer like me it is absolutely
    daunting. I was only ever confronted with high-level
    programming languages like JavaScript, Python and
    Kotlin, where a big chunk of complexity is abstracted
    away.
  </p>
  <p>Additionally, I have never felt the pain, which
    apparently occurs when trying to manually manage memory.
    I have never written a line of C or C++. I have ever
    used languages with a garbage collector, so I never
    sweated much about memory leaks and inefficencies. So
    you might say that -for me - Rust is solving a problem
    that never had.
  </p>
  <h2>New ways of the web</h2>
  <p>So why would a code newbie to this to himself? After
    all, in my own disciplines I am reasonably well versed,
    experienced, and sought-after within the tech-industry.
  </p>
  <p>However, there is a door Rust opens, that might lead to
    a different future of web development. As more and more
    digital products move from running natively on the
    operating system to running in the browser, evermore
    computationally expensive tasks need to be handled. A
    future version of Photoshop - for example - might not be
    downloadable, but just run in a browser window.
    JavaScript though - being single-threaded - is not
    equipped to handle picture manipulation on this scale
    with performance, that would satisfy users.
  </p>
  <h2>WebAssembly to the rescue</h2>
  <p>WebAssembly is a binary instruction format, that
    significantly improves performance for web pages working
    in the browser. Some call this &quot;near native&quot; speed,
    although <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/atc19-jangda.pdf" target="_blank">this might be a somewhat generous term.</a></p>
  <p>While a couple of years ago I had to download Firefox&#39;
    nightly build to preview it&#39;s features, <a href="https://webassembly.org/roadmap/" target="_blank">it has now shipped in all the biggest browsers.</a>
    Back then, it was far too early for me personally to get
    started with it, but as my expertise grew, so grew my confidence
    and with that my desire to learn something more complex and
    be a
    <a href="https://tomvanderbilt.com/books/beginners-the-joy-and-transformative-power-of-lifelong-learning/" target="_blank">beginner
    </a>
    again.
  </p>
  <h2>Why not just Python?</h2>
  <p>Even though I have never worked with it in a
    prefessional setting, I am fairly proficient in Python.
    In my opinion it&#39;s the best choice, whenever developer
    productivity is valued higher than runtime performance.
    Python by itself is extremely slow, but experienced
    Pythonistas know to offload computantionally expensive
    tasks to external packages, which are often implemented
    in C under the hood, making it - for example - data
    scientists weapon of choice.
  </p>
  <h3>Not so fast!</h3>
  <p>Still, my assumption is, <i>(even though I couldn&#39;t find any explicit information
      on this)</i> that Python, still providing a lot of convenience to the
    developer, will be outperformed by a systems-level language
    like Rust, even when run in the context of WebAssembly. The
    garbage collector, doesn&#39;t just go away, after all. I am
    planning to verify this assumption in the near future.
  </p>
  <h3>Thrilling ecosystem</h3>
  <p>An axiom of the Rust community seems to be, that Rust is
    an excellent - if not the best - choice for WebAssembly.
    Such sentiments are often self-fulfilling prophecies, as
    a great ecosystem is powered by community growth, which
    in turn leads to more people contributing and giving
    back to the ecosystem.
  </p>
  <p>This has so far beared fruit in the form of the [yew
    front-end framework,](https://yew.rs/) which is very
    similar to React, but comes with all the benefits
    WebAssembly promises. As things stand right now, I am
    planning to make this framework the focus of my studies,
    once I have climbed the steep first learning curve of
    the basics of Rust.
